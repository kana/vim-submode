==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*submode-introduction*

*submode* is a Vim plugin to provide the way to define "submodes" to the
built-in |vim-modes|.  For example, whenever you type |g-| and/or |g+| to
undo/redo many times, don't you want to type "g++--++..." instead
"g+g+g-g-g+g+..."?  With this plugin, you can define such interface with the
following settings:
>
	call submode#enter_with('undo/redo', 'n', '', 'g-', 'g-')
	call submode#enter_with('undo/redo', 'n', '', 'g+', 'g+')
	call submode#leave_with('undo/redo', 'n', '', '<Esc>')
	call submode#map('undo/redo', 'n', '', '-', 'g-')
	call submode#map('undo/redo', 'n', '', '+', 'g+')
<
The above settings mean:
- Define a new submode named "undo/redo".
- Define "g-" and "g+" as key sequences to enter the submode "undo/redo" from
  Normal mode.  Additionally, they does undo/redo before entering the submode
  "undo/redo".
- In the submode "undo/redo", "-" and "+" do undo/redo.
- In the submode "undo/redo", "<Esc>" leaves the submode.

						*submode-leaving*
By default, <Esc> is automatically defined as a key to leave any submode.
So you don't have to explicitly define like the above example.
There are also 2 ways to leave submodes:
- Type any key sequence which is not mapped in the submode.
  See also |g:submode_keep_leaving_key|.
- Don't type any key for a long time.
  See |submode-variables| to configure the details of this time out.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later

INTERFACE					*submode-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*submode-commands*

:SubmodeRestoreOptions				*:SubmodeRestoreOptions*
			Ex command version of |submode#restore_options()|.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*submode-functions*

						*submode#current()*
submode#current()
			Return the name of the current submode.  If any
			submode is not currently active, return an empty
			string instead.

						*submode#enter_with()*
submode#enter_with({submode}, {modes}, {options}, {lhs}, [{rhs}])
			Define a key mapping to enter the {submode} from
			{modes}.  If {rhs} is given, it will be executed
			whenever entering the {submode} by {lhs}.

			See |submode#map()| for the details of arguments.

						*submode#leave_with()*
submode#leave_with({submode}, {modes}, {options}, {lhs})
			Define a key mapping ({lhs}) to leave the {submode} in
			{modes}.

			See |submode#map()| for the details of arguments.

						*submode#map()*
submode#map({submode}, {modes}, {options}, {lhs}, {rhs})
			Define a key mapping ({lhs} to {rhs}) in the {submode}
			in {modes}.

			{submode}	String
				The name of the submode.  It is recommended to
				use only the following characters:

				Alphabets	A-Z, a-z
				Digits		0-9
				Some symbols	-, _, /

				Note that the submode name is used as parts of
				internal key mappings.  Use a short name.

			{modes}		String
				A sequence of letters which specifies the
				modes to define a key mapping.  The meanings
				of letters are as follows:

				c	Command-line mode
				i	Insert mode
				n	Normal mode
				s	Select mode only
				v	Visual mode and Select mode
				x	Visual mode only

				Note that Operator-pending mode and
				|language-mapping| are not supported, because
				the both modes are always leaved by 1 key
				sequence, so that submdoes can't be built on
				the both modes.

			{options}	String
				A sequence of letters which specifies some
				options for a key mapping to be defined.  The
				meanings of letters are as follows:

				b	Same as |:map-<buffer>|.
				e	Same as |:map-<expr>|.
				r	{rhs} may be remapped.
					If this letter is not included,
					{rhs} will be never remapped.
				s	Same as |:map-<silent>|.
				u	Same as |:map-<unique>|.
				x	After executing {rhs}, leave the
					submode.  This matters only for
					|submode#map()|.

			{lhs}		String
				A key sequence to type.

				To denote a special key such as <Esc>, write
				it in <>-escaped form instead of the character
				as is.  For example, use '<Esc>' instead of
				"\<Esc>".

			{rhs}	String
				A key sequence to be executed by typing {lhs}.

				See also {lhs} for other notes.

submode#restore_options()			*submode#restore_options()*
			Restore options overriden by this plugin.

			This plugin overrides some options before entering
			a submode and restores the options after leaving
			a submode.  <C-c> can be used to leave a submode, but
			it disturbs to restore the options.  Call this
			function if you do so.

						*submode#unmap()*
submode#unmap({submode}, {modes}, {options}, {lhs})
			Delete a key mapping ({lhs} to something) in the
			{submode} in {modes}.

			See |submode#map()| for the details of arguments.
			Note that only "b" matters for {options} and other
			letters are just ignored.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES					*submode-variables*

					       *g:submode_always_show_submode*
g:submode_always_show_submode	boolean (default: false)
	Show always the current submode, even if 'showmode' is disabled.
	Use this option if you use vim-airline or vim-powerline.

	'showmode'  g:submode_always_show_submode  the current submode ~
	off         off                            not shown
	on          off                            shown
	off         on                             shown
	on          on                             shown

						*g:submode_keep_leaving_key*
g:submode_keep_leaving_key	boolean (default: false)
	Whenever you type any key which is not mapped in the current submode,
	it causes to leave from the submode.  In this case, the key is
	consumed by default.  If this variable is set to true, the key is not
	consumed and will be processed by Vim.

	For example, when you type an unmapped key "X" to leave from the
	current submode of Normal mode, the "X" will be consumed by default.
	If this variable is set to true, the "X" will be processed by Vim, so
	that a characer before the cursor will be deleted unless you map |X|
	to something.

						*g:submode_keyseqs_to_leave*
g:submode_keyseqs_to_leave	list of strings (default: ['<Esc>'])
	The default key sequences to leave a submode.

						*g:submode_timeout*
g:submode_timeout		boolean (default: same as 'timeout')
	If this value is true, time out on submodes is enabled.  Otherwise,
	time out is disabled.  If time out is enabled, not typing any key in
	a submode for a long time causes to leave the submode.

	If this variable is not defined, the value of 'timeout' is used
	instead.

						*g:submode_timeoutlen*
g:submode_timeoutlen		number (default: same as 'timeoutlen')
	The time in milliseconds that is waited for typing keys in a submode.

	If this variable is not defined, the value of 'timeoutlen' is used
	instead.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*submode-bugs*

LIMITATIONS ~

- The maximum length of {lhs} of normal key mappings is 50.  Since submode key
  mappings are built on top of normal key mappings, the maximum length of
  a submode {lhs} is shorter than 50.  Usually 10 or more characters are
  available, depending on a submode name.  And it is enough length because you
  don't want to type 4 or more keys to execute a command.

- In {rhs} of a key mapping for a submode, <SID> cannot be used.  Because key
  mappings for a submode is defined by this plugin, not callers.

- To behave the same as Normal mode and Visual mode, any unbound key sequence
  should be ignored in a submode, but it's impossible to implement.

- 'showcmd' is always turned on a submode to render the cursor properly.

- If 'showcmd' is turned on and 'encoding' is set to a non-Unicode encoding,
  ".........." is showed at the bottom right corner while a submode is active.
  This is to hide a part of internal key mappings for submode key mappings.


PROBLEMS ~

- [count] is not supported in a submode.

- |submode#unmap()| does not actually unmap key mappings.  It just replaces
  rhs with <Nop>, but it may cause some problems.

- The current API to define submode key mappings is somewhat low-level.
  It might be useful to add |:map|-like commands for readability.
